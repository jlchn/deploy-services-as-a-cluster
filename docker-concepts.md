## key concepts
- image
    - image is like a template describing the running environment of your applications.
    - layer
        - what is layer? [todo]
        - when building an image, a new layer is created for each individual command in the Dockerfile.  	
- container
    - container is like a running image
    - container is actually a running process on OS
- service
    - a service consists running containers which are created from the same image.
    - a service defines how the image runs(what ports it should use, how many replicas of the container should run)
- swarm
    - enable you distribute services on multiple physical machines, it is defined as a docker cluster
    - swarm manager
    - swarm worker
- stack
    - stack is a group of services that share dependencies, and can be orchestrated and scaled together
